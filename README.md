# Limit Order Book & Matching Engine

This repository contains the C++ implementation of a high-performance Limit Order Book (LOB) and its Matching Engine.

## Overview

The Limit Order Book is designed using a combination of data structures to optimize order insertion, deletion, and matching:

### Architecture

- **Data Structures**: Orders are stored in a doubly linked-list structure, where each list represents a price level. Price levels are managed using Red-Black Trees implemented via `std::set` in C++, ensuring efficient insertion and deletion operations.

- **Order Format**: Orders are added in the format `ID, AgentID, Price, Volume`, and deleted by their id `ID`.

### Performance

To assess performance, the system was tested with 1,000,000 operations (place or delete orders), generated using a Python script. These operations were processed through a CSV parser and fed into the C++ program.

- **High-Performance**: The system achieved a peak performance of **270,000 operations per second**. Operations include order insertions, trades, and order deletions.

## Demo and Usage

For a demonstration, refer to the [Python script](demo/generate_orders.py) used to generate the orders and the corresponding CSV file. This file serves as input to the C++ program, showcasing the handling of large-scale order operations efficiently.
